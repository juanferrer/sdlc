What follows is only an estimation of the order release for future modules, it's always subject to change. New entries in Dungeon of the Damned will take priority over other items
If you're interested in a particular module, let me know and I might be able to accomodate.

- Tombs of Desolation [SDL 1013]
- Uncertain Faith [SDL 1019]
- Dungeon of the Damned: Halls of Death (whenever it comes out)

Check the released modules in the [README](https://github.com/juanferrer/sdlc/blob/main/README.md).
